## üë®‚Äçüíª What was developed:

-   In this project, I received a non-normalized table that simulates Spotify's simplified database, which had to be normalized and populated so that any user can run queries in order to find the requested information.

-   Table normalization in third normal form and accessing information from this table through`queries`using`SQL`.

# project requirements

## challenge 1

-   Create a bank with the name of**`SpotifyClone`**.

-   Provide the queries needed to create normalized tables that meet the requirements described in the section below;

-   Provide the necessary queries to populate the tables according to the data listed in the section below;

    <details>
      <summary><strong>üé≤ Problema a ser resolvido - Normaliza√ß√£o</strong></summary><br />

You will get a non-normalized table similar to what could be a stripped down version of Spotify's database. The work will consist of two parts:

1.  Normalize this table, create the schema in your local database and populate it;

2.  Carry out the challenges in your normalized and populated bank.

    **Observation:**The real Spotify database is much more complete and complex than the one shown below. However, use ONLY the information passed and requested here. Do not create unsolicited data.

    ## Normalize tables to 3rd Normal Form

    Below you can view and download a spreadsheet with the tables to be normalized:

    ![Tabela n√£o normalizada "Spotify Clone"](./images/non-normalized-tables.png)[Download it here](./SpotifyClone-Non-NormalizedTable.xlsx)As VS Code does not support opening spreadsheets, you need to have some specific software for this, here are some suggestions:

-   [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)rather than dubious Linych?
-   [Numbers](https://www.apple.com/br/numbers/)MacOS;
-   Google spreadsheets to use in the browser;
-   Extension for VS Code like Excel Viewer;

    > Note In some OSes, some program is already installed to manipulate spreadsheets.

    First of all, you should model and normalize these tables to 3rd Normal Form. Assemble as many worksheets and tables as you need to create this normalized version as long as you follow the business rules. It is not necessary to create the SQL code at this point.

    **Although not necessary, it is recommended that you create your worksheets in the sequence 1st -> 2nd -> 3rd Normal Form**.

    If in doubt, consult the material already passed to date to help you.

    Your database must follow business rules and be able to recover:


-   Information about which plans are available and their details;
    -   Each user can have only one plan.

-   Information about all artist people;
    -   An artist person can have several albums;
    -   An artist person can be followed by multiple user people.

-   Information about all albums by each artist;
    -   For the purposes of this project, consider that each album has only one person as the main artist;
    -   Each album has several songs.

-   Information about all the songs on each album;
    -   For the purposes of this project, consider that each song is contained in only one album.

-   Information about all users, their plans, their playing history and followed artists.

    -   A user can have only one plan;
    -   Each song in the playback history can only appear once per person (for simplicity, consider that the purpose of the history is to know**which**songs have already been played and**not how many times**were reproduced);
    -   A user person can follow multiple artist people, but each artist person can be followed only once per user person.

    </details>

-   Adjust the settings file`desafio1.json`, which will map in which table and column the necessary information for the automated assessment of this challenge is.

    <details>
    <summary><strong>üëá As configura√ß√µes devem possuir o seguinte formato</strong></summary><br />

    ```json
    {
      "tabela_usuario": "nome-da-tabela-de-usu√°rios",
      "coluna_usuario": "nome-do-usu√°rio",
      "tabela_plano": "nome-da-tabela-do-plano",
      "coluna_plano": "nome-do-plano",
      "tabela_historico_de_reproducoes": "nome-da-tabela-do-historico-de-reprodu√ß√µes",
      "coluna_historico_de_reproducoes": "nome-da-coluna-da-can√ß√£o",
      "tabela_seguindo_artistas": "nome-da-tabela-de-seguidores-dos-artistas",
      "coluna_seguindo_artistas": "nome-da-coluna-da-artista",
      "tabela_artista": "nome-da-tabela-de-artistas",
      "coluna_artista": "nome-da-artista",
      "tabela_album": "nome-da-tabela-de-albuns",
      "coluna_album": "nome-do-album",
      "tabela_cancoes": "nome-da-tabela-de-can√ß√µes",
      "coluna_cancoes": "nome-da-can√ß√£o"
    }
    ```

    This configuration must be based on your database.**after normalization**. That is, if you created a table called`users`which has the column`name`, you would replace`"coluna_usuario"`e`"tabela_usuario"`this way:

    ```json
    {
      "tabela_usuario": "users",
      "coluna_usuario": "name",
      ...
    }
    ```

</details>

-   Save the created queries in the file`desafio1.sql`.

    <details>
    <summary><strong> üëá Seu c√≥digo dever√° ser similar ao seguinte</strong></summary><br />

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS SpotifyClone;

    CREATE DATABASE SpotifyClone;

    CREATE TABLE SpotifyClone.tabela1(
        coluna1 tipo restricoes,
        coluna2 tipo restricoes,
        colunaN tipo restricoes,
    ) engine = InnoDB;

    CREATE TABLE SpotifyClone.tabela2(
        coluna1 tipo restricoes,
        coluna2 tipo restricoes,
        colunaN tipo restricoes,
    ) engine = InnoDB;

    INSERT INTO SpotifyClone.tabela1 (coluna1, coluna2)
    VALUES
      ('exemplo de dados 1', 'exemplo de dados A'),
      ('exemplo de dados 2', 'exemplo de dados B'),
      ('exemplo de dados 3', 'exemplo de dados C');

    INSERT INTO SpotifyClone.tabela2 (coluna1, coluna2)
    VALUES
      ('exemplo de dados 1', 'exemplo de dados X'),
      ('exemplo de dados 2', 'exemplo de dados Y');
    ```

    </details>

‚ú® Tips:

-   ‚ú® Table normalization can be a bit abstract. A theoretical basis will help you, so check the content on Table Normalization without moderation!
-   ‚ú® In this requirement, during normalization, it will be necessary to create tables that reference primary keys of others, creating relationships that can be:
    -   1:1 - For example, an ISBN can only belong to one book and a book can only have one ISBN (ISBN is a unique book registration number);
    -   1:N - For example, a series can have multiple episodes, but an episode only belongs to one series;
    -   N:M - For example, a movie can have several actors and an actor can act in several movies, but neither the actors table should keep movie data, nor the movie table should keep data.

## challenge 6

Based on the value of the plans and the plan that each registered user has at the bank, we want some information about the company's billing. create a`QUERY`which should display four data:

1.  The first column must have the alias "**minimum billing**" and display the lowest existing plan value for a user.

2.  The second column must have the alias "**maximum billing**" and display the highest existing plan value for a user.

3.  The third column must have the alias "**average_invoicing**" and display the average value of plans owned by users so far.

4.  Finally, the fourth column should have the alias "**total billing**" and display the total amount earned with plans owned by users.

For each of these data, as they are monetary values, the invoicing must be rounded using only two decimal places.

‚ú® Tip: The`ROUND`it can be useful here, but it won't create extra decimal places, if you need it, look for a function that will do this formatting.
